Topolor.com v.0.1 is an alpha version system. The objective of this version is to set up the infrastructure and provide basic services. There are several features that seem not as the same as normal web apps, i.e. you have to upload your avatar when you sign up; even you could occasionally find a bug, but please be patient. Sure you are welcome to report bugs to us, as well as tell us your suggestions on the system design.

Why Topolor? The name ‘Topolor’ is from topology, a branch of mathematics. The idea is to connect everything within the system together. For instance, you can easily access related topics according to the tags of the topic that you are currently learning; you can easily access topics related the questions that you incorrectly answered in a quiz; you can easily find who are learning the same topics that you are learning and you can send messages to them for discussion.
